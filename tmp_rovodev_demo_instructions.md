# 🚀 Bookstore Web UI Demo Instructions

## What We've Created

You now have a **complete web UI** for your bookstore project that keeps all your existing backend logic **100% intact**! Here's what was added:

### ✅ What's NEW (Web Layer)
- **Spring Boot Web Application** - Modern web framework
- **REST API Controllers** - `/api/books`, `/api/orders` endpoints
- **Web Page Controllers** - Serve HTML pages
- **Thymeleaf Templates** - Professional-looking web pages
- **Bootstrap UI** - Responsive, mobile-friendly design

### ✅ What's UNCHANGED (Your Logic)
- **All DAO classes** - BookDAO, CustomerDAO, OrderDAO
- **All Service classes** - OrderService, OrderProcessingQueue
- **All Model classes** - Book, Customer, Order, etc.
- **All Utility classes** - DBConnection, algorithms
- **Original Main class** - Still works as before

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

### Option 1: Web Application (NEW)
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
Then open: http://localhost:8080

### Option 2: Console Application (ORIGINAL)
```bash
./gradlew run
```
Same console output as before

## 🌐 Web Features Available

### 📊 Dashboard (Home Page)
- Book statistics (total, in stock, low stock, out of stock)
- Recent books display
- Quick action buttons

### 📚 Books Management

### 🔌 REST API
All your backend logic is now accessible via REST APIs:
- `GET /api/books` - List all books
- `POST /api/books` - Add book
- `PUT /api/books/{id}/stock?quantityChange=5` - Update stock
- And many more...

## 🎯 Key Benefits of This Approach

1. **Zero Changes to Existing Code** - Your logic files are untouched
2. **Dual Interface** - Console app still works + new web UI
3. **API Ready** - Frontend apps can consume your APIs
4. **Professional UI** - Bootstrap-styled, responsive design
5. **Extensible** - Easy to add more web pages and features

## 🚀 Next Steps You Can Take

1. **Try the Web UI**: Run `./gradlew bootRun` and explore
2. **Test APIs**: Use browser or Postman to test `/api/books`
3. **Extend UI**: Add more pages (customers, detailed orders)
4. **Add Features**: Shopping cart, user authentication, etc.
5. **Mobile App**: Use the same APIs for a mobile app
